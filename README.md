We present **S**et-**o**f-**M**ark (SoM) prompting, simply overlaying a number of spatial and speakable marks on the images, to unleash the visual grounding abilities in the strongest LMM. GPT-4V.

Our method compiles the following models to generate the set of marks:

- [Mask DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/MaskDINO): State-of-the-art closed-set image segmentation model
- [OpenSeeD](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OpenSeeD): State-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation model

We are standing on the shoulder of the giant GPT-4V ([playground](https://chat.openai.com/))!

### :rocket: Quick Start

* Install segmentation packages

```bash
# install SEEM
pip install git+https://github.com/UX-Decoder/Segment-Everything-Everywhere-All-At-Once.git@package
# install SAM
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
# install Semantic-SAM
pip install git+https://github.com/UX-Decoder/Semantic-SAM.git@package
# install Deformable Convolution for Semantic-SAM
cd ops && sh make.sh && cd ..

# common error fix:
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/MaureenZOU/detectron2-xyz.git'
pip install mpi4py
```

* Download the pretrained models

```bash
sh download_ckpt.sh
```

* Run the demo

```bash
python demo_som.py
```

Users can select which granularity of masks to generate, and which mode to use between automatic (top) and interactive (bottom). A higher alpha blending value (0.4) is used for better visualization.
### :unicorn: Interleaved Prompt
SoM enables interleaved prompts which include textual and visual content. The visual content can be represented using the region indices.

## Use case

In comparison to GPT-4V without SoM, adding marks enables GPT-4V to ground the
reasoning on detailed contents of the image (Left). Clear object cross-image references are observed
on the right.

Case study on solving CAPTCHA. GPT-4V gives the wrong answer with a wrong number
of squares while finding the correct squares with corresponding marks after SoM prompting.

Case study on an image of dish for GPT-4V. GPT-4V does not produce a grounded answer
with the original image. Based on SoM prompting, GPT-4V not only speaks out the ingredients but
also corresponds them to the regions.
### :mosque: Personalized Suggestion

SoM-pormpted GPT-4V gives very precise suggestions while the original one fails, even
with hallucinated foods, e.g., soft drinks
### :blossom: Tool Usage Instruction
<img width="734" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-18 at 10 19 39" src="https://github.com/microsoft/SoM/assets/34880758/9b35b143-96af-41bd-ad83-9c1f1e0f322f">
Likewise, GPT4-V with SoM can help to provide thorough tool usage instruction
, teaching
users the function of each button on a controller. Note that this image is not fully labeled, while
GPT-4V can also provide information about the non-labeled buttons.

GPT-4V with SoM gives a reasonable suggestion on how to achieve a goal in a gaming
scenario.

### :deciduous_tree: Results
We conduct experiments on various vision tasks to verify the effectiveness of our SoM. Results show that GPT4V+SoM outperforms specialists on most vision tasks and is comparable to MaskDINO on COCO panoptic segmentation.
